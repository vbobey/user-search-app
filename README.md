## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Search for GitHub users by their username.
- See relevant user information based on their search.
- Switch between light and dark themes.
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences (`prefers-color-scheme` in CSS).
